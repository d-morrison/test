## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished presentation. To learn more about Quarto presentations see <https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/>.

## Bullets

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes:

-   Content authored with markdown
-   Output from executable code

## Code

When you click the **Render** button a presentation will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

```{r}
library(DT)
library(dobson)
dobson::birthweight |> DT::datatable()

```

```{r}
birthweight 
```

```{r}
#| label: tbl-birthweight-data-1
#| tbl-cap: "`birthweight` data"
library(dobson)
data("birthweight", package = "dobson")
knitr::kable(birthweight)
```
