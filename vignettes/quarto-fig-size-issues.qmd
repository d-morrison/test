## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished presentation. To learn more about Quarto presentations see <https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/>.

## Bullets

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes:

-   Content authored with markdown
-   Output from executable code

## Code

When you click the **Render** button a presentation will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

## a figure that works

```{r}
#| label: fig-plot2
#| fig-cap: "a ggplot figure"

library(ggplot2)
set.seed(1)

sample_df <- data.frame(
  group = factor(rep(letters[1:3], each = 10)),
  value = rnorm(30)
)

group_means_df <- setNames(
  aggregate(value ~ group, sample_df, mean),
  c("group", "group_mean")
)

ggplot(data = sample_df, mapping = aes(x = group, y = value)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_point(
    mapping = aes(y = group_mean), data = group_means_df,
    colour = 'red', size = 3
  )

```

## a figure that doesn't work

```{r}
#| label: fig-plot3
#| fig-cap: "another ggplot figure"
#| fig-height: 3

library(ggplot2)
set.seed(1)

sample_df <- data.frame(
  group = factor(rep(letters[1:3], each = 10)),
  value = rnorm(30)
)

group_means_df <- setNames(
  aggregate(value ~ group, sample_df, mean),
  c("group", "group_mean")
)

plot1 = 
  ggplot(data = sample_df, mapping = aes(x = group, y = value)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_point(
    mapping = aes(y = group_mean), data = group_means_df,
    colour = 'red', size = 3
  )

print(plot1)
```
