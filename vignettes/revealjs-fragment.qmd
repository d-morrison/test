:::{.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out}
* This course is about *generalized linear models* (for non-Gaussian outcomes)
:::

:::{.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out}
* UC Davis STA 108 ("Applied Statistical Methods: Regression Analysis") is a prerequisite for this course, so everyone here should have some understanding of linear regression already.
:::

:::{.fragment .fade-in}
* We will review linear regression to:
  - make sure everyone is caught up
  - to provide an epidemiological perspective on model intepretation.
