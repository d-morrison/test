## definition 1

:::{#def-density}
## density function

The density function $f(t)$ for a random variable $T$ at value $t$ can be defined as the derivative of the cumulative probability function $P(T\le t)$; that is:

$$f(t) = \frac{d}{dt} \Pr(T\le t)$$

## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished presentation. To learn more about Quarto presentations see <https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/>.

## Bullets

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes:

-   Content authored with markdown
-   Output from executable code

## Code

When you click the **Render** button a presentation will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

:::{#def-hazard}
## Hazard function

The hazard function for a random variable $T$ at value $t$ is the conditional density of $T$ at $t$, given $T\ge t$; that is:

$$h(t) = p(T=t|T\ge t)$$
